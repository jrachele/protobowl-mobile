# Protobowl Mobile

A Flutter-based project to act as a front end for Protobowl.com, a real-time trivia application
for studying Quizbowl.

The project uses Websockets to communicate with the Protobowl server, and uses Redux to manage
state throughout the application.

## Installation

Currently, the app is not available on any of the official platforms, but you can deploy it to your device by installing the Flutter framework and following the instructions to build it on your device. For performance purposes, it is advised that you build it in 'Release' mode instead of Debug mode so that the code is native and not a Dart VM.
